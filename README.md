Twin Cities Relief Initiative
------------------------------

This is a mock site that I created for a local nonprofit. The site was created based on their style as well as some feedback from the nonprofit founder. The site was created with the following tech stack
HTML5,CSS, Javascript,Bootstrap,React, and deployed using the Google Cloud Platform. This project showcases my understanding of web development as well as web design.
